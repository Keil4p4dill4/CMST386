      <h2><i>How Search Engines Work</i></h2>
      <p>Search engines basically scan and organize information from websites all over the internet. They use programs called <u>crawlers</u> or <u>spiders</u> to visit pages, follow links, and store what they find in a huge database called an index. When someone searches for something, the search engine sorts through that index and ranks pages based on how relevant and trustworthy they seem. It’s like a smart library system that quickly helps people find exactly what they’re looking for.</p>

      <h2><i>Why Keywords and Meta Descriptions Matter</i></h2>
      <p>Keywords and meta descriptions play a <i>big role</i> in helping search engines understand what a page is about. Using the right words in your content and meta tags can make your site show up in the right searches. A strong meta description also gives users a quick preview of your page, encouraging them to click through. <br>Basically, it’s your first impression—so make it <u>easy to use</u>, <u>relevant</u>, and <u>engaging</u>.</p>

      <h2><i>Four Elements of Writing Relevant Content Links</i></h2>
      <p>When writing relevant content links, four key things matter: context, relevance, anchor text, and destination. The <strong>context</strong> around a link should match what the user expects to find. The <strong>relevance</strong> of the linked page should actually support your topic. The <strong>anchor text</strong>—the clickable words—should clearly describe what it links to. Finally, the <strong>destination</strong> page should be trustworthy and valuable to the reader.</p>

      <h2><i>What Makes a Good Heading Hierarchy</i></h2>
      <p>A good heading hierarchy keeps a page <b>organized</b> and <b>easy</b> to read—for both visitors and search engines. It starts with one <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag that introduces the main topic, followed by <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> tags for subtopics and smaller sections.</p>
